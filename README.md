WordPress Builder
=================

Just a very basic script that downloads the latest WordPress zipfile, and any specific plugins and themes, assembles them and creates a ZIP file.

Optionally, it will deploy the ZIP file to an application hosting service. Currently that is AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
